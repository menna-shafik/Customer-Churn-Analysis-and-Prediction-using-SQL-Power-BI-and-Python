# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction using SQL, Power BI, and Python

## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn data, identify key factors driving customer attrition, and predict churn risks.  
I used **SQL** for data cleaning and exploration, **Power BI** for data visualization, and **Python** for machine learning modeling.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation (SQL)**
   - Connected to the database
   - Removed duplicates and NULLs
   - Standardized data formats
   - Performed exploratory data analysis using SQL queries

2. **Data Visualization (Power BI)**
   - Built interactive dashboards showing customer churn insights
   - Visualized churn rate trends, demographics, and service usage patterns
   - Highlighted key KPIs affecting customer retention

3. **Predictive Modeling (Python)**
   - Conducted feature engineering
   - Trained a logistic regression model
   - Evaluated model performance (accuracy, precision, recall)
   - Identified high-risk customers based on model predictions

4. **Business Insights & Recommendations**
   - Suggested targeted actions to improve customer retention
   - Presented findings visually and in summary reports
